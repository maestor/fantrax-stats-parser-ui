# Codebase Structure

This guide documents the durable structure of the repo.

Generated and transient directories such as `.angular/`, `dist/`, `node_modules/`, and local editor/system files are intentionally omitted.

## Route Families And Shells

### Dashboard Routes

- `/`
- `/player-stats`
- `/goalie-stats`
- direct `/player/...` and `/goalie/...` routes

These routes use the shared root-shell drawer/header plus the lazy stats shell for tabs and comparison UI.

### Browse Routes

- `/career/*`
- `/draft/*`
- `/leaderboards/*`

These routes render under the lighter root shell and intentionally avoid dashboard-only UI.
They still inherit the root-shell settings button plus the base drawer sections.

## Shared UI Building Blocks

### `src/app/shared/top-controls/`

- team, start-from-season, season, and report controls
- stats-mode sections rendered inside the shared settings drawer

### `src/app/shared/settings-panel/`

- stats mode, min games, and player-only position filtering
- rendered inside the shared settings drawer only for stats-mode routes

### `src/app/shared/settings-drawer/`

- shared drawer content used by the root shell across every route
- always renders the base sections and appends mode-specific sections from one centralized extension point
- draft and leaderboard routes add a separate drawer section for the selected-team-highlight toggle after the shared team switcher section
- new drawer groups should be added here as sibling `.settings-drawer-section` wrappers so spacing, borders, and future drawer-wide styling changes stay centralized

### `src/app/shared/stats-table/`

- `StatsTableComponent` for interactive dashboard/leaderboard tables
- `VirtualTableComponent` for read-only virtualized career lists

### `src/app/shared/table-card/`

- compact paged card/table presentation for highlight and draft statistics views

### `src/app/shared/section-jump-nav/`

- shared sticky browse-route pill navigation with overflow cues for horizontally scrollable section jump bars

### `src/app/shared/player-card/`

- player/goalie dialog, tabbed details, graphs, deep-link support, and in-dialog navigation

## Service Layer

The service layer is broader than just API and filters. Important services include:

- `api.service.ts`
- `cache.service.ts`
- `comparison.service.ts`
- `drawer-context.service.ts`
- `filter.service.ts`
- `footer-visibility.service.ts`
- `pwa-update.service.ts`
- `seo.service.ts`
- `server-translate.loader.ts`
- `settings.service.ts`
- `stats.service.ts`
- `team.service.ts`
- `viewport.service.ts`

For service responsibilities and behavior notes, see `docs/service-guide.md`.

## Tests And Tooling

- App behavior and service specs mostly live next to source under `src/app/**`
- End-to-end coverage lives under `e2e/`
- `e2e/page-objects/`, `e2e/helpers/`, `e2e/fixtures/`, and `e2e/scripts/` support the Playwright workflow

## Reading Order For Contributors And Agents

When orienting yourself in the repo, this order is usually fastest:

1. `README.md`
2. `docs/README.md`
3. `src/app/app.routes.ts`
4. `src/app/app.component.ts`
5. `src/app/dashboard-shell/`
6. The relevant feature route/container
7. `docs/project-testing.md` and `docs/accessibility.md` before changing behavior or UI

## Maintenance Rule

Update this file when the durable structure changes.

Do not expand it into a file-by-file inventory or a list of generated folders that contributors do not need for orientation.
