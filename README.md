# fantrax-stats-parser-ui

## Purpose

Once made lightweight API to parse my NHL fantasy league team stats and print combined seasons results by player (regular season &amp; playoffs separately) as JSON, [node-fantrax-stats-parser](https://github.com/maestor/node-fantrax-stats-parser). It have been useful but without UI it's quite tricky to use. So here is one simple UI for those stats. Selected Angular framework as a base because I haven't use it in work related stuff since 2016, and thinking this is better for me learning and developing skills than do it with for example something like React or Vue.js which I have working experience in recent years.
